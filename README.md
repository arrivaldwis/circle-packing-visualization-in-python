# Circle packing visualization in python

I realized that i couldn't find any bubble chart like the ones you can create in D3.js or R. 

To be honest I just needed this script to finish a simple degree job, but as I have needed to use it again I have decided to put some comments and some ideas and modifications in it to use the code I found in stackexchange with csv files and minor aesthetic changes.

Just a simple script to make a (slow generated) simple bubble visualization  in Python

### Warning, this chart is made by brute force, so it is quite slow. I have only used it in small datasets to make a proof of concept (due to the fact that I couldn'y use anything but python). PLEASE, use D3.js or R to make them instead of python. They are much much prettier than this one.
