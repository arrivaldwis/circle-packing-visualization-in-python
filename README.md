# circle packing visualization in python
I realized that i couldn't find any bubble chart like the ones you can create in DÂ·.js or R. 
To be honest I just needed this script to finish a simple degree job, but as I have needed yo use it again I have decided to put some comments and some ideas and modifications in it.

Just a simple script to make a (slow generated) simple bubble visualization  in Python
### Warning, this chart is made by brute force, so it is quite slow. I have only used it in small datasets to make a proof of concept (due to the fact that I couldn'y use anything but python). Consider use D3.js or R to make them instead of python. They are prettier
